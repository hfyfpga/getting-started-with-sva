The code isn't written to be reader friendly. Its main goal is to be run in
SBY and generate traces. One (cover) property per run makes it easier to open
traces in GTKWave, because the trace is always 'trace0.vcd'.


To shorten the prompt (because of long directory names):

    export PROMPT_DIRTRIM=1


To set up run script:

1. Create a virtual env:

    python3 -m venv ./venv

2. Activate virtual env

    source venv/bin/activate

3. Install packages

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Add 'bin' directory to path

    export PATH=$(readlink -f bin):$PATH
